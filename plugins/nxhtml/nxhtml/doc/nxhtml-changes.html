              I want to thanks the testers, especially Hadron Quark
              and Eric Lilja, for helping me by testing and pointing
              out bugs and weaknesses, most related to editing of PHP.

          <dt id="magic-problems" style="margin-top:1em;">Magic major mode selection</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Sometimes the major mode that Emacs opens a file in is
              not what you expect. This can happen with files like PHP
              files.  The reason might be that magic-mode-alist have
              choosen a mode based on the content of the file. The way
              this is done does not take files with mixes a mix of for
              example XHTML and PHP into account.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may try setting magic-mode-alist to nil if this is a
              problem for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>
                This is now no longer necessary since the introduction
                of magic-fallback-mode-alist in CVS Emacs on 2007-05-16.
                (If you have an Emacs newer than that, of course.)

          <dt id="underline-bug" style="margin-top:1em;">Long Red Underlines</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Because of a bug in Emacs 22 you can sometimes (at the
              end of a line) get long red lines instead of just a
              single underlined character.  Many users (me included)
              find this quite a bit disturbing. I have therefore added
              a command to quickly hide/show the underlines. This is
              on <em>C-c C-w</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is particular useful for example in the case where
              you edit a PHP file and are bound to get a lot of XHTML
              validation errors.

            <p>
              If you want to have attribute values computed by PHP
              here is a way how to structure that to avoid breaking
              completion and validation in the XHTML part unnessecary:
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:2em">
              &lt;img src="images/linux.png" title="&lt;?php foo("bar");?&gt;"/>
            </p>
            <p>
              (This was a tip from Hadron.)

          <dt id="pi-note" style="margin-top:1em;">A note for PHP and it's cousins</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              The rules for a process instruction in XML, like &lt;?php
              ... ?&gt; says that the text can contain any text except
              <em>?&gt;</em>. So if you want to output that string
              from PHP then break it up so it does not look as ?&gt; in
              the source file.
            </p>
            <p>
              It might be good to break up the beginning part of the
              process instructions too.

          <dt id="pi-note" style="margin-top:1em;">Perl Mode slow with Mumamo Mode</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Perl mode used with MuMaMo mode sometimes makes the
              fontification slow for big files.  I do not know the
              reason, but I am trying to find a solution for this.  If
              you encounter this problem, just turn off mumamo-mode in
              that buffer.
            </p>

          <dd>
            <p>
              Do you have <em>tab-width</em> to something different than 8
              (the default)? Then please change this to 8. I have got
              reports of problem with indentation when it is not 8.

                Corrected autostart for nXhtml when not used together with EmacsW32.

                Improved display of XML path.

              <li>
                Discontinued xmple-mode.
              </li>
              <li>
                New major modes nxhtml-part-mode/nxml-part-mode replaces
                minor mode xmlpe-mode.  (While moving the code to
                nxhtml-part.el I also fixed a bug in Xmple minor mode that
                made Emacs take 99% of the CPU.)

                as me.
              </li>
              <li>
                Glued together things so that editing PHP files works
                as I intended. (This means that Emacs switches between
                php-mode and nxhtml-part-mode automatically when
                moving point. And that you can use completion.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Starting working on the documentation for nXhtml.
                New layout to the documentation files.
                Examples with images.

                Fixes to make the switching between php and xhtml
                style editing work better.

              <li>
                Better error handling when switching to editing
                embedded JavaScript and CSS.
              </li>
              <li>
                Removed PHP spec from embedded switching since they
                interfered with the automatic switching between php
                and xhtml.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gives an error message if web host is not defined in
                site when trying to use View Uploaded File and
                cousins.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gives a ready message when finished uploading a single
                file.
              </li>
              <li>
                When using Mode Switching at &lt;? ... ?&gt; mode
                switching could occur in wrong buffer. Fixed together
                with some other buffer problems.

              </li>
              <li>
                Included a CSS mode.
              </li>
              <li>
                Added a menu entry for bug reporting.
              </li>
              <li>
                Renamed menu bar entry from XHTML to nXhtml for clarity.
                (But nXml menu bar entry is still called XML.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Added work around for globalized minor modes in the
                cases of MLinks, XML Path and mode switching at &lt;? ... ?&gt;.

                Added workaround for the problem with the first
                keyboard key after automatically switching of mode at
                &lt;? ... ?&gt;.

                Added support for multiple major modes with mumamo.el.
              </li>
              <li>
                More conventient handling of links. They can now be
                opened in the same window, 'other window' or in a new
                frame.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Schema was not setup after starting new page so
                completion did not work. Fixed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Added http://xhtml.com/ to help sites for XHTML.
              </li>
              <li>
                Added the concept of <em>XML validation headers</em>.
                These are just text parsed by the nXml validation
                parser to get a start state before starting parsing a
                buffer.  This allows the use of the nXml completion in
                buffers where there are no XML header.  Such a header
                is often lacking for example in PHP code since the
                XHTML header is often generated dynamically.
              </li>
              <li>
                Because of the change above <em>nxhtml-part-mode</em>
                is no longer needed and is therefore declared
                obsolete.
              </li>
              <li>
                Corrected a bug in mlinks.el that prevented opening an
                HTML link in a other window or a new frame.
              </li>
              <li>
                Added support for JSP, eRuby and some support for perl
                in mumamo.el.

                There is a bug in Emacs 22 in the handling of global
                minor mode that are not distributed with Emacs. If
                they are turned on by customization, but loaded after
                Emacs have loaded the customizations (usually in
                .emacs) then they are not turned on correctly. Added

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Possible to hide validation warnings without turning
                on validation (which would make completion in the
                XHTML part impossible).
              </li>
              <li>
                Some fixes to php-mode:
                <ul>
                  <li>Using the character # for comments now works for most cases.</li>
                  <li>Now uses the fontification faces in a more standard way which calms down the look.</li>
                  <li>Initialization bug fixes.</li>
                  <li>Renamed php-mode-user-hook to php-mode-hook to follow standard.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Indentation fixes:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Various corrections to indentation in mumamo.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added the possibility to use TAB to indent regions
                    (indent-region-mode).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Warn about bad indentation in mixed PHP/HTML code
                    when using php-mode only.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Fontification now fontifies all text first in main
                major mode and thereafter applies submodes. (This
                avoids some problems with around a submode chunk.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Reorganized the nXhtml menu:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    There is now a minor mode for the nXhtml
                    menu. This makes it possible to easier use common
                    features when in buffers not in nxhtml-mode.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The nXhtml menu does not disappear when moving
                    into a chunk where the major mode is not
                    nxhtml-mode.  The changes also makes it easy to
                    access uploading functions functions etc from
                    other modes than nxhtml-mode since the
                    <em>nXhtml</em> may also be shown in them.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The nXhtml menu can be turned on globally by default.
                    Customize nxhtml-menu-mode for that.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

                Reached version number 1.00 - which you maybe believe
                means the bugs should be gone? Sorry, it is just that
                I ran out of version numbers ;-) However it looks like
                much fewer bugs at least.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fixed problems mostly related to global turn on of different features in nXhtml.
              </li>
              <li>
                Small fixes to indentation.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    nxhtml-mode could get confused by php tags.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    nxhtml-mode did not indent &lt;!DOCTYPE in a sensible way.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Electric keys now works in embedded php when using mumamo-mode.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Tidy was very misbehaving since the output buffer was
                not erased between different files. But I have got no
                bug reports on this ;-)
              </li>
              <li>
                Fixed a bug in validation that should up when using muamo-mode.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fixed bug in &lt;script ...> and &lt;style ...> chunk dividing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Added support for OpenLaszlo.
              </li>
              <li>
                Corrections to mlinks-mode (visible mostly as links in
                XHTML buffers):
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Links disappeared when a new file was
                    opened. Corrected.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Links were not correctly updated at changes in the
                    buffer when mumamo-mode was used. Fixed.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                The welcome message for nXhtml could be shown too
                early sometimes when loading, before nXhtml actually
                knew if it should be shown or not. Tried to fix it.
              </li>
            </ul>

                Reported wrong version number for nXhtml in the menus. Fixed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>If you use the zip file to install nXhtml please
                notice that it has now a top level nxml.</em> Sorry for not
                having zipped it like that before!
              </li>
              <li>
                The url links in <em>Welcome to nXhtml</em> was a bit
                incorrect and did not work on all OS:es. Fixed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Added customization of popup completion to the 'nxhtml
                customization group so they are easier to find.
              </li>

                MuMaMo
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Struggled a bit with the load sequences of the elisp
                    libraries used by nXhtml when using MuMaMo.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Tried to get the global turn on of mumam-mode to work
                    in all cases.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The screen was blinking when changing overlays after
                    changes in the buffer. Tried to fix this.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Minor fixes do syntax highlighting, like taking care of single ':s.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Fixes to the support for JSP and eRuby.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Made the support for perl here documents a bit better.
                    Large perl documents are however still quite slow when
                    using mumamo-mode.  I do not know the reason yet.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Refontification could miss some parts when buffer
                    changes caused chunk division changes. Complex,
                    tried to fix it, but I am a bit unsure that it
                    always works.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Cleaned up mumamo.el a bit.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Rewrote mumamo-test.el and functions called from it in
                    mumamo.el a bit to make tracebacks from errors more
                    useful. Changed keybindings in mumamo-test.el from
                    global to a minor mode <em>mumamo-test-mode</em>.
                    Renamed mumamo-notest.el to mumamo-test.el.  Added it
                    to the zipped distribution of nXhtml.

                Reworked the messages for fontification errors to try
