2006-02-19  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-version-string): Release ERC 5.1.2.

2006-02-15  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc): Move to the end of the buffer when a continued
	session is detected.  Thanks to e1f and indio for the report and
	testing a potential fix.

2006-02-14  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* debian/changelog: Prepare a new Debian package.

	* Makefile (debprepare): New rule that creates an ERC snapshot
	directory for use in both new Debian releases and revisions for
	Debian packages.
	(debrelease, debrevision-mwolson): Use debprepare.

	* NEWS: Bring up-to-date.

	* erc-stamp.el (erc-insert-timestamp-right): For now, put
	timestamps before rather than after erc-fill-column when
	erc-timestamp-right-column is nil.  This way we won't surprise
	anyone unpleasantly, or so it is hoped.

2006-02-13  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-dcc.el: Use (eval-when-compile (require 'cl)).

2006-02-11  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-stamp.el (erc-timestamp-use-align-to): Renamed from
	`erc-timestamp-right-align-by-pixel'.  Set the default based on
	whether we are in Emacs 22, and using X.  Improve documentation.
	(erc-insert-aligned): Remove calculation of offset, since
	:align-to pos works after all.  Unlike the previous solution, this
	one works when erc-stamp.el is compiled.
	(erc-insert-timestamp-right): Don't add length of string, and then
	later remove its displayed width.  This puts timestamps after
	erc-fill-column when erc-timestamp-right-column is nil, rather
	than before it.  It also fixes a subtle bug.  Remove use of
	`current-window', since there is no variable by that name in
	Emacs21, Emacs22, or XEmacs21 beta.  Check to see whether
	`erc-fill-column' is non-nil before using it.

2006-02-11  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-spelling.el (define-erc-module): Make sure there's a buffer
	before calling `with-current-buffer'.

2006-02-10  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (debbuild): Split from debrelease.
	(debrevision-mwolson): New rule that causes a Debian revision to
	be built.

2006-02-08  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc.el (erc-version-string): Remove "(CVS)".
	(erc-open-ssl-stream): Go back to using ssl.el so that SSL
	connections work as expected.  Connecting with `open-tls-stream'
	only seems to work (if at all?) when using the tls.el located in
	lisp/net/ in Emacs22.

	* NEWS: Added tls.el -> ssl.el change.

2006-02-07  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-stamp.el (erc-insert-aligned): Don't take 3rd argument.  Use
	the simpler `indent-to' function when
	`erc-timestamp-right-align-by-pixel' is nil.
	(erc-insert-timestamp-right): If the timestamp goes on the
	following line, don't add timestamp properties to the spaces in
	front of it.

2006-02-05  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (debrelease): Remove images/.arch-ids or images/CVS
	directory correctly.

	* debian/changelog: Update for 5.1.1 release.

	* debian/control (Suggests): Suggest emacs-chess instead of
	Recommending it.  Thanks to Era Eriksson for the report.

	* debian/maint/postinst: Install the Info documentation.

	* debian/maint/prerm: Handle removing of Info documentation.

	* debian/rules (configure, configure-stamp, build, build-stamp):
	Generate HTML and Info documentation.
	(binary-erc): Install HTML and Info documentation.

	* erc-spelling.el (erc-spelling-init): If
	`erc-spelling-dictionaries' is nil, do not set
	ispell-local-dictionary.  Before, it was being set to nil, which
	was causing a long delay while the ispell process restarted.
	(erc-spelling-unhighlight-word): New function that removes
	flyspell properties from a spell-checked word.
	(erc-spelling-flyspell-verify): Don't spell-check nicks or words
	that have '/' before them.

2006-02-04  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (VERSION): Update to 5.1.1.

	* NEWS: Update for ERC 5.1.1.  Use the same wording for headings
	that Emacs does in its NEWS file.

	* erc-autojoin.el: Use (eval-when-compile (require 'cl)).

	* erc-complete.el (erc-nick-completion-exclude-myself)
	(erc-try-complete-nick): Use better function for getting list of
	channel users.

	* erc-goodies.el: Docfix.

	* erc-stamp.el: Use new arch tagline, since the other one wasn't
	being treated properly.

	* erc.texi (History): Note that ERC is now included with Emacs.

	* erc.el (erc-version-string): Release ERC 5.1.1.

2006-01-31  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-stamp.el: Update copyright years.

2006-01-30  Simon Josefsson  <jas@extundo.com>

	* erc.el (erc-open-ssl-stream): Use tls.el.

2006-01-30  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-stamp.el (erc-timestamp-right-align-by-pixel): New option
	that determines whether to use pixel values to align right
	timestamps.  The default is not to do so, since it only works with
	Emacs22 on X, and even then some people have trouble.
	(erc-insert-aligned): Use `erc-timestamp-right-align-by-pixel'.

2006-01-29  Edward O'Connor  <ted@oconnor.cx>

	* erc-viper.el: Ensure we only alter Viper's configuration when
	necessary, as Viper may already take ERC into account.

2006-01-29  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* ChangeLog, ChangeLog.2005, ChangeLog.2004, ChangeLog.2003,
	ChangeLog.2002, ChangeLog.2001: Add "See ChangeLog.NNNN" line for
	earlier changes.  Use utf-8 encoding.  Fix some accent typos.

	* erc-speedbar.el (erc-speedbar-buttons): Fix reference to free
	variable.
	(erc-speedbar-goto-buffer): Fix compiler warning.

	* erc-ibuffer.el: Use `define-ibuffer-filter' instead of
	`ibuffer-degine-limiter'.  Use `define-ibuffer-column' instead of
	`ibuffer-define-column'.  Require 'ibuf-ext so that the macros
	work without compiler warnings.

	* man/erc.texi (Obtaining ERC, Installation): Note that these
	sections may be skipped if using the version of ERC that comes
	with Emacs.

2006-01-28  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-*.el, erc.texi, NEWS: Add Arch taglines as per Emacs
	guidelines.

	* erc-*.el: Space out copyright years like the rest of Emacs.  Use
	the Emacs copyright statement.  Refer to ourselves as ERC rather
	than "Emacs IRC Client", since there are now several IRC clients
	for Emacs.

	* erc-compat.el (erc-emacs-build-time): Define as a variable.

	* erc-ibuffer.el: Require 'erc.

	* erc-log.el (erc-log-setup-logging): Use write-file-functions if
	it exists.

	* erc-stamp.el (erc-insert-aligned): Only use the special text
	property when window-system is X.

	* erc.texi (History): Note that ERC 5.1 is released.

2006-01-28  Johan Bockg√•rd  <bojohan@users.sourceforge.net>

	* erc.el (erc-format-message): More `cl' breakage; don't use
	`oddp'.

2006-01-27  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* debian/changelog: Update for new release.

	* debian/control (Description): Update.

	* debian/rules: Concatenate ChangeLog for 2005.

	* Makefile (MISC): Include ChangeLog.2005 and erc.texi.
	(debrelease, release): Copy images directory.

	* NEWS: Spelling fixes.  Add items for recent changes.

	* erc.el (erc): Move call to erc-update-modules before the call to
	erc-mode.  This should fix a timestamp display issue.
	(erc-version-string): Release ERC 5.1.

2006-01-26  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-stamp.el (erc-insert-aligned): New function that inserts
	text in an perfectly-aligned way relative to the right margin.  It
	only works well with Emacs22.  A sane fallback is provided for
	other versions of Emacs.
	(erc-insert-timestamp-right): Use the new function.

2006-01-25  Edward O'Connor  <ted@oconnor.cx>

	* erc.el (erc-modules): Ensure that `erc-button-mode' gets enabled
	before `erc-match-mode'.

	* erc-match.el (match): Append `erc-match-message' to
	`erc-insert-modify-hook'.

2006-01-25  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* FOR-RELEASE: Mark last release requirement as done.

	* Makefile (realclean, distclean): Remove docs.

	* erc.texi: Take care of all pre-5.1 items.

	* erc-backend.el (erc-server-send, erc-server-send-queue): Wrap
	`process-send-string' in `condition-case' to avoid an error when
	quitting ERC.

	* erc-stamp.el (erc-insert-timestamp-right): Try to deal with
	variable-width characters in the timestamp and on the same line.
	The latter is a kludge, but it seems to work with most of the
	input I've thrown at it so far.  It's certainly better than going
	past the end of line consistently when we have variable-width
	characters on the same line.  When `erc-timestamp-intangible' is
	non-nil, add intangible properties to the whitespace as well, so
	that hitting <end> does what you'd expect.

	* erc.el (erc-flood-protect, erc-toggle-flood-control): Update
	this to only use boolean values for `erc-flood-protect'.  Update
	documentation.
	(erc-cmd-QUIT): Set the active buffer to be the server buffer, so
	that any QUIT-related messages go there.
	(erc): Try to be more clever about re-using channel buffers when
	automatically re-connecting.  Thanks to e1f for noticing.

2006-01-23  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* ChangeLog.2005: Remove erroneous line.

	* FOR-RELEASE: Make that the Makefile tweaking is complete.
	(NEWS): Mark as done.

	* Makefile (MANUAL): New option indicating the name of the manual.
	(PREFIX, ELISPDIR, INFODIR): New options that specify the
	directories to install lisp code and info manuals to.  PREFIX is
	used only by ELISPDIR and INFODIR.
	(all): Call `lisp' and create the manual.
	(lisp): Compile lisp code.
	(%.info, %.html): New rules that make Info files and HTML files,
	respectively, from a TexInfo source.
	(doc): Create both the Info and HTML versions of the manual.  This
	is for the user -- we never call it automatically.
	(install-info): Install Info files.
	(install-bin): Install compiled and source Lisp files.
	(todo): Remove, since it seems pointless.

	* NEWS: Update.

	* README: Add Installation instructions.  Tweak layout.

	* erc.texi: Work on some pre-5.1 items.

	* erc-stamp.el, erc-track.el: Move some functions and options in
	order to get rid of a few compiler warnings.

	* erc.el (erc-modules): Enable readonly by default.  This will
	prevent new users from accidentally removing old messages, which
	could be disconcerting.  Also enable stamp by default, since
	timestamps are a fairly standard feature among IRC clients.

	* erc-button.el: Munge whitespace.

	* erc-identd.el (erc-identd-start): Instead of throwing an error,
	just try to use the obsolete function.

2006-01-22  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-backend.el (erc-decode-string-from-target): Make sure that
	we have a string as an argument.  If not, coerce it to the empty
	string.  Hopefully, this will work painlessly around an edge case
	related to quitting ERC around the same time a message comes in.

2006-01-22  Johan Bockg√•rd  <bojohan@users.sourceforge.net>

	* erc-track.el: Use `(eval-when-compile (require 'cl))' (for
	`case'). Doc fixes.
	(erc-find-parsed-property): Simplify.
	(erc-track-get-active-buffer): Fix logic. Simplify.
	(erc-track-switch-buffer): Remove unused variable `dir'. Simplify.

	* erc-speak.el: Doc fixes.
	(erc-speak-region): `propertize' --> `erc-propertize'.

	* erc-dcc.el (erc-dcc-chat-parse-output): `propertize' -->
	`erc-propertize'.

	* erc-button.el (erc-button-add-button): Take erc-fill-prefix into
	account when wrapping URLs.

	* erc-bbdb.el (erc-bbdb-elide-display): Doc fix.

	* erc-backend.el (define-erc-response-handler): Doc fix.

2006-01-22  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc.el (erc-update-modules): Use `require' instead of `load',
	but prevent it from causing errors, in order to preserve the
	previous behavior.

2006-01-21  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* FOR-RELEASE (Source): Mark cl task as done.

	* Makefile (erc-auto.el): Call erc-generate-autoloads rather than
	generate-autoloads.
	(erc-auto.el, %.elc): Don't show command, just its output.

	* NEWS: Add items from 2005-01-01 to 2005-08-13.

	* debian/copyright (Copyright): Update.

	* erc-auto.in (erc-generate-autoloads): Rename from
	generate-autoloads.

	* erc.el, erc-autoaway.el, erc-backend.el: Use
	erc-server-process-alive instead of erc-process-alive.

	* erc.el, erc-backend.el, erc-ezbounce.el, erc-list.el,
	erc-log.el, erc-match.el, erc-nets.el, erc-netsplit.el,
	erc-nicklist.el, erc-nickserv.el, erc-notify.el, erc-pcomplete.el:
	Use (eval-when-compile (require 'cl)), so that compilation doesn't
	fail.

	* erc-fill.el, erc-truncate.el: Whitespace munging.

	* erc.el: Update copyright notice.  Remove eval-after-load code.
	(erc-with-buffer): Docfix.
	(erc-once-with-server-event, erc-once-with-server-event-global)
	(erc-with-buffer, erc-with-all-buffers-of-server): Use erc-gensym
	instead of gensym.
	(erc-banlist-update): Use erc-delete-if instead of delete-if.
	(erc): Call `erc-update-modules' here.

	* erc-backend.el: Require 'erc-compat to minimize compiler
	warnings.
	(erc-decode-parsed-server-response): Docfix.
	(erc-server-process-alive): Move here from erc.el and rename from
	`erc-process-alive'.
	(erc-server-send, erc-remove-channel-users): Make sure process is
	alive before sending data to it.

	* erc-bbdb.el: Update copyright years.
	(erc-bbdb-whois): Remove overexuberant comment.

	* erc-button.el: Require erc-fill, since we make liberal use of
	`erc-fill-column'.

	* erc-compat.el (erc-const-expr-p, erc-list*, erc-assert): New
	functions, the latter of which provides an `assert' equivalent.
	(erc-remove-if-not): New function that provides a simple
	implementation of `remove-if-not'.
	(erc-gensym): New function that provides a simple implementation
	of `gensym'.
	(erc-delete-if): New function that provides a simple
	implementation of `delete-if'.
	(erc-member-if): New function that provides a simple
	implementation of `member-if'.
	(field-end): Remove this, since it is unused, and later versions
	of XEmacs have this function already.
	(erc-function-arglist): Moved here from erc.el.
	(erc-delete-dups): New compatibility function for dealing with
	XEmacs.
	(erc-subseq): New function copied from cl-extra.el.

	* erc-dcc.el: Require pcomplete during compilation to avoid
	compiler warnings.
	(erc-unpack-int, erc-dcc-send-filter)
	(erc-dcc-get-filter): Use erc-assert instead of assert.
	(pcomplete/erc-mode/DCC): Use erc-remove-if-not instead of
	remove-if-not.

	* erc-match.el (erc-log-matches): Fix compiler warning.

	* erc-nicklist.el: Update copyright notice.
	(erc-nicklist-menu): Change use of caadr to (car (cadr ...)).
	(erc-nicklist-bitlbee-connected-p): Remove.
	(erc-nicklist-insert-medium-name-or-icon): Accept channel
	argument.  Use it to determine whether we are on bitlbee.  Now
	that bitlbee names its channel "&bitlbee", this is trivial.
	(erc-nicklist-insert-contents): Pass channel as specified above.
	Don't try to determine whether we are on bitlbee here.
	(erc-nicklist-channel-users-info): Use erc-remove-if-not instead
	of remove-if-not.
	(erc-nicklist-search-for-nick): Use erc-member-if instead of
	member-if.

	* erc-notify.el (erc-notify-QUIT): Use erc-delete-if with a
	partially-evaluated lambda expression instead of `delete' and
	`find'.

	* erc-track.el: Use erc-assert.
	(erc-track-modified-channels): Remove use of `return'.
	(erc-track-modified-channels): Use `cadr' instead of `second',
	since otherwise we would need yet another eval-when-compile line.

2006-01-19  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-backend.el (erc-process-sentinel-1): Remove attempt to
	detect SIGPIPE, since it doesn't work.

2006-01-10  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-spelling.el: Updated copyright years.
	(define-erc-module): Enable/disable `flyspell-mode' for all open
	ERC buffers as well.
	(erc-spelling-dictionaries): Reworded customize description.

	* erc.el (erc-command-symbol): New function.
	(erc-extract-command-from-line): Use `erc-command-symbol'.  This
	fixes a bug where "Symbol's function definition is void:
	erc-cmd-LIST" would be shown after typing /list at the prompt (the
	command was interned because erc-menu.el uses it and is enabled by
	default whereas erc-list.el is not).

	* NEWS: Started a list of renamed variables.

	* erc.el: Reworded the message sent when defining variable
	aliases.
	(erc-command-indicator-face): Doc fix.
	(erc-modules): Enable the match module by default which makes
	current nickname highlighting on as the default.

	* erc-button.el: Updated copyright years.
	(erc-button): New face.
	(erc-button-face): Use `erc-button'.
	(erc-button-nickname-face): New customizable variable.
	(erc-button-add-nickname-buttons, erc-button-add-buttons-1): Send
	new argument to `erc-button-add-button'.
	(erc-button-add-button): Doc fix.  Added new argument to function
	definition, NICK-P.  If it's a nickname, use
	`erc-button-nickname-face', otherwise use `erc-button-face'.  This
	makes channel tracking and buttons work better together when
	`erc-button-buttonize-nicks' is enabled, since there is a nickname
	on just about every line.

	* erc-track.el (erc-track-use-faces): Doc fix.
	(erc-track-faces-priority-list): Added `erc-button' to list.
	(erc-track-priority-faces-only): Doc fix.

2006-01-09  Diane Murray  <disumu@x3y2z1.net>

	* erc-button.el (erc-button-url-regexp): Use `concat' so the
	regexp is not one long line.
	(erc-button-alist): Fixed so that customizing works correctly.
	Reorganized.  Removed lambda functions with more than two lines.
	Doc fix.
	(erc-button-describe-symbol, erc-button-beats-to-time): New
	functions.  Moved from `erc-button-alist'.

2006-01-07  Michael Olson  <mwolson@gnu.org>

	* erc-backend.el (erc-process-sentinel-1): Don't try to re-open a
	process if a SIGPIPE occurs.  This happens when a new message
	comes in at the same time a /quit is requested.
	(erc-process-sentinel): Use string-match rather than string= to do
	these comparisons.  Matching literal newlines makes me nervous.

	* erc-track.el (erc-track-remove-from-mode-line): Handle case
	where global-mode-string is not a list.  Emacs22 permits this.

See ChangeLog.2005 for earlier changes.
