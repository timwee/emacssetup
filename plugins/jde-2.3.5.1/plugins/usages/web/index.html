    <p>
    <b>jde-usages</b> is a plugin for the <a href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/">Java Development
      Environment for Emacs</a> (JDEE) that uses the <a href="http://asm.objectweb.org/">ASM</a>
      bytecode library to provide usage (eg: find all the callers of a method) and other useful
      information about your Java classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plugin is based on the ideas in jde-xref.el that is
      distributed with JDEE but it is better because it is:</p>
      <ul>
	<li><p><b>Faster.</b> Initial setup is <a a href="#Notes">faster</a>. Parsing byte-code is also much faster when done in
	java instead if elisp.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>More Accurate. </b>
	  The usage information <b>jde-usages</b> provides is as up to
	  date as the class files and jars in the classpath. You are
	  not required to rebuild the database after compiling.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>Easier to setup</b> 
	  No extra configuration is required. <b>jde-usages</b> examines all the classes in
	  jde-global-classpath and therefore doesn't require a separate classpath of generated
	  files or a prefix list.</p></li>
      </ul>
      
      <b>jde-usages</b> also uses the information it gathers to
      provide some useful <a href="commands.html#other">commands</a>.<br />

      <h2 id="Requirements">Requirements</h2> 
      <p>To use <b>jde-usages</b> you need to have customized <code>jde-global-classpath</code> and
      <code>jde-sourcepath</code> for your project. The classpath provides a set of classes to search in
      when looking for usages while the sourcepath is used when navigating to the exact location of
      a usage. You will also need to have your JDK set up correctly so that bsh can start
      up. If you've gotten JDEE completion to work, you should be fine.</p>

      <h2 id="Download">Download</h2> An installable plugin binary of
      version 0.10 released on Feb 27, 2006 is available
      <a
      href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jde-usages/jde-usages-0.10.zip?download">here</a>
      along with <a href="ReleaseNotes">release notes</a> and the
      detailed <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>.  This file
      also includes all the source files used to build the plugin.
      <p>
        The source is also available via anonymous CVS <a
      href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=103724">here</a>. </p>

      <h2 id="Installation">Installation</h2>
      <p><b>Using the binary: (jde-usages.zip)</b> </p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Unzip the plugin zip file in the JDEE plugin directory,
	  if you haven't customized <i>jde-plugins-directory</i> this
	  is the <i>plugins</i> directory under the JDEE install
	  directory. Unzipping the plugin will create a directory
	  called <i>usages</i> under <i>plugins</i>.</li>
          <li> Restart emacs. </li>
	</ol>
        OR <br />
        you could accomplish the same thing from within emacs:
        <ol>
	  <li>Copy the file plugin zip file to the JDEE plugin
	  directory. Delete any old <b>jde-usages</b> plugin zip or
	  <i>usages</i> subdirectory.</li>

          <li> Then say M-x jde-pi-install-plugins. This will only
          work if you have the "jar" executable in your
          exec-path.</li>  

          <li>Kill any running beanshell process by saying M-x jde-bsh-exit.

          <li> Finally say M-x jde-pi-load-plugins to load the plugin.
            This will however not give you the new menu items for
            <b>jde-usages</b>. You have to restart for that.</li>
	</ol>

      <p><b>From CVS:</b> The source is structured to look like an expanded plugin and so can be
      installed directly into the plugins directory.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Check out the sources into your JDEE plugin
	  directory. This will create a folder called
      <i>usages</i> under <i>plugins</i>.</li>
	  <li> Go to the <i>usages</i> directory and say "ant build". This populates the
      <i>usages/classes</i> directory. Typing just "ant" without any targets will print out help
      about the other targets that can be built.</li>
	  <li> Restart emacs. You can also say M-x jde-pi-load-plugins
	  to load the plugin but the plugin submenu will not show up
	  until emacs is restarted.</li>
	</ol>

      <h2 id="UsefulKeybindings">Useful Keybindings</h2> I find the following Keybindings useful in
      addition to the menu bar commands. <br/><b>Note:</b> The bindings use "M-u" as a prefix command,
      overriding its default binding of 'upcase-word, which I almost never use. YMMV.
      <blockquote><pre>
(define-key jde-mode-map "\M-u" nil)
(define-key jde-mode-map "\M-up" 'jde-usages-display-call-tree-for-thing-at-point) ;; p = point

                              (jde-open-class-source-with-completion)))</pre></blockquote>
      <h2 id="Notes">Notes</h2>

      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p id="setup"> During the setup phase <b>jde-usages</b> looks at the constant
      table for every class to determine which other classes it refers to and uses this info. to
      create a dependency table which maps a class to all classes that <b>might</b> call that
      class. It's critical that this stage be as fast as possible. It is much faster than jde-xref
      ,which in its setup phase parses the byte-code of all methods to create the final usage
      table and then writes this data structure to disk, but it won't hurt to make it faster.</p>
	
	<h3>Caching:</h3>
	<p id="Cache"> Directory classpath entries take longer to process than jars because reading many small
	files turns out to be much slower than reading one large one. To mitigate this problem there
	is some experimental support to cache the processing results for directory classpath entries
	between runs. To enable this caching create a directory called ".jde-usages" in your home
	directory. To find out what java thinks is your home directory type </p>
	<blockquote><pre>print (System.getProperty("user.home"));</pre></blockquote> in the *bsh*
	buffer. If the ~/.jde-usages directory exists cache files will we written there just before
	the JVM quits. To ensure that the java process is allowed to shut down completely when
	quitting emacs add the following code to your .emacs file.
	  
	  <blockquote>
	    <pre>
(defun jde-bsh-exit-nicely ()
  "Tells the beanshell process to terminate and waits until the process finishes up."
  (interactive)
  (if (jde-bsh-running-p)
      (let ((process (bsh-get-process (oref 'jde-bsh the-bsh))))
	(message "Shutting down beanshell process")
        (if (and
             (boundp 'jde-ant-invocation-method) ;; ant package may not be loaded.
             (string= (car jde-ant-invocation-method) "Ant Server"))
            (bsh-eval (oref 'jde-bsh the-bsh) "jde.util.JdeUtilities.exit();\n")
	  (bsh-eval (oref 'jde-bsh the-bsh) "exit();\n"))
	(message ""))))

(add-hook 'kill-emacs-hook 'jde-bsh-exit-nicely)</pre></blockquote>

	<h3>Debugging</h3>
	<p> A special buffer called <code>*jde-beanshell-scratch*</code> records the
	  data returned by calls the java code in jde.util.Usages. When reporting bugs the contents
	  of this buffer would be useful. This buffer is not truncated right now and so could get to
	  be very large.</p>
	<p>Setting <code>jde.util.Usages.DEBUG</code> to <code>true</code> in the beanshell buffer will make
	  <b>jde-usages</b> report some timing information.</p>

      <h2 id="Help">Help</h2>To report bugs, request features, or heap
      accolades, send <a href="mailto:sacharya@cs.indiana.edu">me
      (Suraj Acharya)</a>
      an email. I also monitor the <a
      href="mailto:jde@sunsite.dk">JDEE mailing list</a> pretty
      closely.
