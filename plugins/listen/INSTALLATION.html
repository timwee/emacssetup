  <h1>Installation</h1>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Windows XP or Windows 2000
    </li>
    <li>NaturallySpeaking 7 Preferred (or Professional) edition (or perhaps lower)
    </li>
    <li>GNU Emacs &gt; 21.3 (or perhaps 21.3). 
    </li>
    <li>AUCLaTeX for LaTeX support (only if necessary)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Install software</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Unpack the distribution into a directory (folder), say
      <tt>c:\Emacs</tt>.  This will create a subdirectory
      <tt>c:\Emacs\listen</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>In your <tt>.emacs</tt> file, add the following:
      
      <pre style="font-family: Courier;">
	(when (eq window-system 'w32)

          ;; ADJUST THIS PATH IF NECESSARY ---&gt;
	  (setq listen-path "c:/Emacs/listen")
	  (setq-default load-path (cons listen-path load-path))

	  ;; EmacsListen will turn it on anyway; best to get used to it
  	  (transient-mark-mode 1)

	  ;; LOAD VR-MODE

	  (load (concat listen-path "/vr-mode/vr"))

	  ;; These commands below may not be desired if you are
	  ;; already using vr-mode's voice commands

	  (setq vr-activate-minibuffer nil)
	  (setq vr-activation-list nil)
	  (setq vr-voice-command-list nil)
	  (setq vr-command (concat listen-path "/vr-mode/vr.exe"))

	  ;;; LOAD EMACSLISTEN

	  (require 'listen-mode)

	  ;; Load speech engine specific interface, here Barry Jaspan's vr-mode
	  ;; for ScanSoft NaturallySpeaking as modified to work with EmacsListen
	  (require 'listen-vr-additions)

	  ;; (Optional) Load listen-peek (display of yank, search histories,
	  ;; and color coded excerpts of recent views of files)
	  (require 'listen-peek)

	  ;; (Optional) Activate listen-peek mode
	  (listen-peek-mode 1)

	  ;; (Optional) Load key and mouse definitions
	  (load "listen-keys")

	  ;; Recommended (make garbage collection occur less often)
	  (setq gc-cons-threshold 10000000)
	)
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>For e-mail support, you must change the appropriate bindings
      in the <tt>grammar.elg</tt> file (for example,
      replace <tt>'my-read-all-e-mail</tt> with <tt>'rmail</tt>).
      And, issue <tt>M-x listen-load-grammar</tt> to compile and load
      your changes.
    </li>
    <li>
      For LaTeX letterwriting, you might want to use the <tt>tech
      write letter</tt> command, which initializes a buffer with your
      personal information.  Customize the
      variable <tt>listen-tex-letter-template</tt> for this purpose.
    <li>
    <li>Note that <strong>everything you say</strong> (while
      EmacsListen is listening) ends up in the file named
      <tt>listen-transcript-file</tt> (the default
      is <tt>transcript.xml</tt> in your <tt>listen-path</tt>
      directory).  Set this variable to <tt>nil</tt> if this potential
      privacy-intrusive behavior is not desired.
    </li>
	
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Setting up NaturallySpeaking</h2>

  <ul>

    <li>Backup your user file or make a copy of the folder (presumably
      while NaturallySpeaking is not running; this folder is perhaps to be
      found in <tt>C:\Documents and Settings/All
	Users/Application Data/ScanSoft/NaturallySpeaking/Users</tt>).
    </li>

    <li>Now, NaturallySpeaking must learn about the ShortTalk words that
      are not part of English.  In NaturallySpeaking, choose
      <strong>Words --&gt; Import</strong>, and select the file:
      <tt><a href="ShortTalk-wordlist.txt">c:\Emacs\listen\ShortTalk-wordlist.txt</a></tt>
    </li>


    <li>These words should now be trained.  Use <strong>Words --&gt;
	View/Edit</strong> and in the Display field, choose "Custom words
      only".  Unless you already have a lot of custom words, just select
      all of them.  Then click on "Train" to provide your pronunciation
      for each of them.  In case you do have a lot of custom words, you
      may have to chase down individual words manually.
    </li>


    <li>We can now import the definition of the word sequences that form
      ShortTalk commands.  Apparently, NaturallySpeaking with infer the
      pronunciation of the sequences now that we have provided a
      pronunciation of each ShortTalk constituent.  So, in
      NaturallySpeaking, choose <strong>Words --&gt; Import</strong>, and select the file:
      <tt>c:\Emacs\listen\grammar.txt</tt>.  This file is very big and it
      does not contain all possible ShortTalk commands.
    </li>

    <li>(Optional) It might be useful to build language models that
      reflect ShortTalk usage.  I am not sure about what is the best
      approach.  One idea is to take the transcript files that
      ShortTalk produces in order to gather a personalized corpus.
      The XSLT program <tt>trainingset.xslt</tt>
      in <tt>transcript-programs</tt> might be useful.  It is also
      possible that the adaptive algorithms of NaturallySpeaking are
      sufficient for satisfactory performance.  In fact, it may even
      be possible that the vocabulary building process may hamper
      performance. 
    </li>
    
    <li>That's all.  Now power up Emacs and issue <tt>M-x
	listen-mode</tt>.  That will start <tt>vr-mode</tt> so that all
      output from NaturallySpeaking is directed to
      the <tt>*EmacsListen*</tt> buffer, where EmacsListen parses the
      text into dictation and commands.</li>

  </ul>
