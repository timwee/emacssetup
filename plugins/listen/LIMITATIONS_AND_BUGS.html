    <h1>Limitations and Bugs</h1>

    <h2>General Design Issues</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<strong>The performance of NaturallySpeaking on ShortTalk is
	  suboptimal.
	</strong>
	It is actually amazing that the current solution works at
	all.  Very often, however, misrecognition  will occur that
	is plainly impossible had the speech recognizer been engineered
	with the  ShortTalk grammar in mind.  I have no
	doubt that very substantial improvements are possible.  An
	excellent project in an academic setting!   
      </li>

      <li><strong>EmacsListen only ShortTalk-enables Emacs.</strong>
	This is a serious limitation of course.  EmacsListen is only a
	proof of concept.  Moreover, it is not obvious how to even
	formulate a strategy for enabling other applications at the level
	of perfection that EmacsListen offers and that is so crucial for
	speech recognition to be usable.  Perfect consistency among
	applications can probably be obtained only if one common text
	engine (for calculating text intervals, normalization of spaces,
	lines, and capitalization) underlies all applications.  Choosing
	EmacsListen as such an engine might be viable.  It does not entail
	that users have to learn anything about Emacs, of course.

      <li>
	<strong>Documentation could be much better.</strong>
      </li>
      
      <li><strong>The code for spacing and capitalization should be completely
	  rewritten.</strong> And, probably the new functionality should
	be based on probabilistically identified rules.  An excellent
	student project!</li>
      <li><strong>The concept of listen event and the modifications to the
	  command loop are horribly complex.</strong> Yes, there are two
	reasons for this: (1) although ubiquitous, the concept of queuing
	events in queues is fundamentally flawed if events may be defined in
	terms of events (as is a case with keyboard macros and command
	sequences in Emacs).  [A better way to handle is to queue them in
	trees, similar to the call trees of procedural abstractions.] (2) It
	did not seem possible to avoid using them; in particular, the
	concept of 'tair' (mouse-position) seems to call for command
	sequences.  Additionally, the undo mechanism also relies on
	seq
uences of events.  Much of the complexity stems from the
	requirements of perfect undoability.
      <li><strong>The code for identifying balanced
	  structures (parentheses, terms, quotations) is too
	  'hardwired'.</strong> The solutions that Emacs offers are 
	inadequate because they are tied to the concept of mode.  However,
	in practice, we now find mixture of modes everywhere: LaTeX snippets
	in e-mail, EcmaScript in XML, XML in comments in C, etc.  The
	current code is not perfect: a general model of flexible,
	context-dependent parsing of text should be developed. 
      </li>
      

      <li><strong>Phonetic, morphological, and semantic choices in
      ShortTalk.</strong></li>
	
    </ul>



    <h2>Specific Bugs</h2>

    <ul>
      
      <li><strong>Tab keys are not displayed correctly the listen
	  buffer.</strong>
	They confuse VR-mode.  Use "toob" instead.
      </li>
      
      <li><strong>pc-select or delete-selection mode not
	  tested.</strong>These modes must be loaded before listen-mode
	(since the listen-mode pre-command-hook must be executed before
	any changes to the buffer by other hooks). [These modes have not
	been tested with EmacsListen.] Instead, cua-mode is recommeded.
      </li>


      <li><strong>Brown color extends everywhere.</strong> The mechanism
	EmacsListen uses for indicating mairk and loost is a little
	problematic.  Sometimes, the indication for mark stretches over many
	characters.  There is probably a specific bug to be fixed.  However,
	with the new display facilities of Emacs 21, this code
	should probably be totally reengineered.
      </li>

      <li><strong>The function fill-paragraph mode in XML does not always
	  work as expected.</strong> This is not a problem with
	EmacsListen.
      </li>

      <li><strong>The number of $-signs is sometimes not correctly counted for
	  LaTeX-awareness.</strong>
	In the paragraph below:
	<pre>Words $w$ and $w'$ that interpret all variables in the same way satisfy the
	  same set o   f formulas: if for all $i$, $1\leq i \leq K$,
	</pre>
	The ShortTalk command <em>save term tair</em>, with the mouse over
	the beginning of <tt>$1\leq</tt>..., does not recognize the whole
	expression <tt>$1\leq i \leq K$</tt>.
      </li>

      <li><strong>The command <em>go aift loon twain</em> does not go to a
	  blank line as expected.</strong> This functionality used to work.

      </li>

      <li><strong><em>snex hotel numeral 2</em> or <em>snex H2</em> asks
	  for attribute in minibuffer</strong> This is an issue with html-mode.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Lack of generalization <em>vox menu tair</em></strong>
	When ShortTalk encounters the language instinct, forms of commands
	may be spoken that are not yet implemented.  This is one such
	example.</li>

      <li><strong>Spacing for URLs.</strong> This doesn't always work: for
	example, saying ``A T T dot com'' results in
	<tt>ATT.  Com</tt>.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Spacing after <tt>p.</tt></strong> There should be one
	space, not two.     
      </li>	 


      <li><strong>Listen peek windows get mixed up.</strong>Sometimes
	other applications within Emacs steal these windows.</li> 

      <li><strong><tt>listen-conventional-undo</tt> is buggy. Problem is
      bad when listen-mode has not been activated. <em>This has been
	    corrected NK 9/7.</em></li>
